Feature: display list of tasks filtered by user
 
  As a developer
  So that I can quickly browse tasks assigned to a user
  I want to see tasks assigned to certain users

Background: tasks have been added to database

   Given the following restaurants exist:
  | restaurant_name         | address | phone_number |
  | Outback Steakhouse      | 900     | 000-000-0009 |
  | Chipotle      		    | 800     | 000-000-0003 |
  | McDonalds      			| 700     | 000-000-0007 |
  | MacNGrill     			| 600     | 000-000-0008 |
  | Zios   					| 150     | 000-000-0002 |
  | Olive Garden       		| 500     | 000-000-0001 |

  And I am on the Tickets&Tables home page
