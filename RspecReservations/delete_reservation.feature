Feature: Delete (effectively cancel) a reservation
 
  As a customer
  So that I can cancel a reservation
  I want to be able to delete my reservation of choice from a list of my reservations

Background: And I am on the ViewReservation page

Scenario: Should be able to delete a reservation
	When I press Delete 
	Then I should be on the MyReservations page
	And I should see "Reservation was successfully deleted."
