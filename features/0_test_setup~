Feature: Set up all cucumber tests to run independently (in any order works).

Scenario: Should be able to edit a created restaraunt 1
	Given I am on the CreateRestaurant home page
	When I fill in "restaurant_restaurant_name" with "Outback"
	And I fill in "restaurant_store_ID" with "999"
	And I fill in "restaurant_phone_number" with "111-222-3333"
	And I fill in "restaurant_address" with "1234 Road"
	When I press "submit"
	Then I should see "Restaurant Successfully Created!"
