  As an customer
  So that I can view an existing reservation
  I want to be able to view the details of my reservation of choice from a list of my reservations

Background: And I am on the MyReservations home page
 
Scenario: Should be able to view a reservation
	When I follow Chipotle 
	Then I should be on the ViewReservation page
	And I should see "Chipotle"	
	And I should see "1999-01-07 04:05:06"
	And I should see "4"
	And I should see "test"
	And I should not see "McDonalds"
	And I should not see "Zios"
	And I should not see "1999-01-08"
